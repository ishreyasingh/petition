<a class="link-subtle" href="/u/997056913">Shreya Singh</a> started this petition to <a class="link-subtle" href="/decision-makers/united-nations-environment-program-3">United Nations Environment </a></strong></div></div></div><div class="mbl type-break-word type-l rte"><p>The&nbsp;Amazon, the largest&nbsp;rainforest&nbsp;in the world, is suffering from large amounts of&nbsp;deforestation, or the clearing of trees.&nbsp;More than 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres lost every year! More than 20 percent of the&nbsp;Amazon rainforest&nbsp;is already gone, and much&nbsp;more is severely threatened as the&nbsp;destruction&nbsp;continues. It is estimated that the&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;alone is vanishing at a rate of 20,000 square miles a year. About one quarter of the western medicine used today has ingredients that originated in the Amazon Rainforest. With so many unidentified trees and plants, it is logical to conclude that many more have medicinal value that has not yet been discovered. If deforestation continues, we may never know how many more have potential to help save lives.People need oxygen to survive and the Amazon's trees and plants are responsible for providing more than 20% of the worldâ€™s oxygen. People from around the world rely on the Amazon for a huge portion of their daily diets. Fruits, nuts, rice, corn, coffee, potatoes, vegetables, spices, and many other important foods are grown here. The availability of these foods will become scarce if the rainforest, as we know it, disappears. With continued activities of deforestation, we may be heading towards a detrimental end to one of the most important regions of the world which is helping in preservation and conservation of various species of the world.</p>
<p>Government needs to take immediate steps to stop the massive deforestation, starting with the Amazon Rainforest. I would urge all to sign this petition so that it can voice the concern we all have and help in finding a solution to it to save our world.&nbsp;</p>
